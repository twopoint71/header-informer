# header-informer
A simple script to show what the server sees. I wrote this a long time ago as a troubleshooting tool in my web hosting days for when I could not access client servers. I would ask them to temporarily install this tool, to aid in troubleshooting site issues. It seems silly, but we had network level layer 7 filters, or clients would misconfigure their servers. So, on a few occassions, this idea was helpful. The theming is reminiscent of the old line printers with that funky green and white lined paper. As kids, we made paper noise-poppers from those giant sheets of paper. 

# warning
The php code is probably vulnerable. This should only be used for educational purposes. Seriously, don't put this anywhere and leave it if you care about your server.
